# mafiaChat

This was a University group project for Java Workshop module. We had to build application that makes use of client-server interaction and the use of Subversion.
We were called The Nice team.
The Nice team has evaluated a variety of project ideas and has concluded to design a program that combines messaging whilst playing a game. 
We plan to create a Mafia Chat game. The aim of the messaging app will essentially be to allow users to message one another as well as participate in the game.
